### Mission
**OutrunLabs** is a personal research initiative focused on the intersection of **aviation systems**, **machine learning**, and **predictive autonomy**.  
The goal is to explore how artificial intelligence can assist flight crews (or aircraft themselves) in anticipating atmospheric hazards, optimizing routes, and enhancing operational safety.

OutrunLabs was founded by OutrunPilot, a commercial airline pilot combining real-world cockpit experience with a passion for AI, design, and systems integrity.

### Focus Areas
- **Predictive Weather Deviation** - AI systems that detect and anticipate convective activity  
- **Autonomous Decision Support** - augmenting pilot awareness and route planning  
- **Human-AI Interface Design** - intuitive feedback loops for trust and transparency  
- **Data-Driven Safety Analytics** - leveraging radar and meteorological patterns for insight

### Active Projects

#### [Outrunner](https://github.com/outrunpilot/outrunner)
> AI-based predictive weather deviation concept  
> Research on using neural inference and atmospheric pattern recognition to anticipate hazardous weather before traditional radar systems detect it.  
> *Status:* Concept Phase (v0.1 - Public Timestamp)

### Lab Philosophy
OutrunLabs values:
- **Precision** - grounded in aviation logic and procedural discipline  
- **Creativity** - inspired by retro-futurism and 1980s design language  
- **Integrity** - transparency of process, respect for data, and system reliability  

Every project here is a step toward a safer, smarter, and more autonomous flight future.
